## My process

### Built with

- Normal HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learnt that you could add a linear-gradient to a background with a url image. Also i learnt how to add custom variables to a linear gradient. The down side about this is that if added an rgba or hsl variables, you can't add opacity to it on the same line.

- example:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background: url("image"), linear-gradient(var(--Very-pale-blue), var(--Pale-blue));
}
```

### Continued development

- image resizing
- element positioning
- linear-gradient
- box-showing

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) - This helped me with the basics of box-shadowing.
- [Example resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2504071/how-do-i-combine-a-background-image-and-css3-gradient-on-the-same-element) - This gave me an insight on how to solve the variable issue in linear-gradient.
